- contracts
    / we get a new agreement every time, how to proceed?
    - cache (location/deletion/duration)
    - cache as a proxy before consumer (dask persist)

    - reuse repr/res

- key agent (later)
    - eclipse conenctor
    - data plane transfer client https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/tree/main/extensions/data-plane-transfer/data-plane-transfer-client
    - BA not alway about implementation, talk about secutiry model in thesis, no implementation

    - data plane transfer client can be used for filling the cache

    - eclipse as na outlook / or implemenrt


- evaluation
    - need way better documentation
    - prep task
    - something easy like avg, mean calculation
    - sus etc.
    - control group? just give them the task, see how they do
    - treatment group > give info about this package

    - both: IDS satisfaction with both of them

    - negative eff: caching mmagixc?

    - infra: colab/forms
    - consider rewards to even out motivation / use ppl from the project


- problems
    - remote artifacts can't be generalized at all.

- cite:
    - idsa position paper usage control:
        - 34 table
        - 26 leaks
    - intake dcat
        - for it's readme and catalog impl

- use cases:
    - first partition provide access, later until deletion / duration
